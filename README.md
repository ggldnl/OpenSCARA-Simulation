# OpenSCARA Simulation

This repository includes the code to simulate the SCARA in a PyBullet environment.

For a complete overview of the project, refer to the [main OpenSCARA repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/OpenSCARA).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and deployment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ggldnl/OpenSCARA-Simulation.git
    ```

2. Create a conda environment:

    ```bash
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate openSCARA-sim
    ```

3. If for whatever reason you need to update the submodules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --remote --recursive
    ```

## üöÄ Delpoy

- `simulation.py` will show the arm moving in a straight line to a target point (in task space, i.e. x, y, z, yaw). The default target point is (0.2, 0, 0.15, 1.57[rad]) but can be changed passing the desired values as argument. 

    ```bash
    python simulation/showcase_animations.py -x 0.1 -y 0.1 -z 0.1 -yaw 1.57
    ```
